# <span class="jbobau">...</span> — Naked Trees and Vines

|  | A lone pomegranate tree with no leaves sits in front of the house.
|  | From its old gray branches hang weathered red pomegranates that were not harvested in the fall.
|  | The fruit is split open and a small songbird bounces around the tree into the pomegranates, taking some seeds back to a branch.
|  | Its little wings flutter quickly as it darts around.
|  | 
|  | Past the mandarin orchard, full of green leaves and orange fruit, fig trees tower toward the sky.
|  | White branches crossing left and right, making their way up with not a leaf on them.
|  | The orchard floor is partially covered with brown fig leaves that have fallen from the tree and are beginning their journey back into the soil.
|  | 
|  | Next to the fig orchard are the peaches and plums.
|  | They too stand tall, without a leaf on them.
|  | The stone fruit trees have branches that are decorated with rusty red and burgundy colors.
|  | The floor beneath them shows no leaves as they have been hidden by the lush cover crops that are now 18 inches tall.
|  | In this small forest of cover crop, last season's peach and plum leaves are amassed near the soil surface, breaking down and creating more organic matter.
|  | 
|  | Beyond the stone fruit orchard, at the base of the hills covered with green grass and leafless oak trees, sits the grape vineyard.
|  | This is the most tangled set of branches we have.
|  | Vines have grown amongst one another, weaving in, out, through, over and back again.
|  | Their color is red, but a different shade than in the fall, and their shapes do not stretch for the sky but weave along the trellis, — planned and trained by their farmer.
|  | 
|  | Now is the season to prune.
|  | The grape vines will be cut back to their main branches, leaving as neat and orderly as the trellis on which they were planted.
|  | The figs will not be touched; they will be encouraged to grow tall and their prudence in the number of new branches they add each year will be trusted.
|  | The stone fruit trees will be pruned; specific branches are selected to remain on the tree to promote the wine glass shape that is best for yielding large fruit and making sure they get enough sun to add a summer-color blush to the skins.
|  | 
|  | Winter is here, but the turkeys are already foreshadowing spring, with the beginnings of their struts and shows of tail feathers.
|  | We had better get ready for spring too!
