.i le mi'a cange cu sutrai sazri
: Our farm is operating at full speed. We are in the middle of the summer harvest. The tall tomato vines are still yielding precious gems, but the plants are beginning to look old and tired on the first planting. The tips of their vines are bright green with new growth, however closer to the ground, shades of yellow and brown can be seen. The tomatoes have grown all the way up to the top of the five-foot stakes that were placed in the ground to guide them toward the sun. At the other end of the farm are second and third plantings that are just starting to be harvested. Beyond that is a fourth planting that we have not taken a tomato from yet. These plants are vibrant green with no sign of fading, despite the heat.

.i ...
: The melon harvest is happening now. The melon plants have grown to cover the entire field, leaving no view of the brown dirt and only the green of melon plants with the occasional shiny melon. The melon plants on the west end of the field, which were the last to be planted, are a more vibrant green, and the sun highlights the new vines that are stretching up toward the sky, holding their little yellow melon flowers out for the bees to pollinate. Soon those flowers will be weighted down with quickly growing little melons.

.i ...
: Beyond both of those fields is our creek. Amidst the water and moss growth, tracks of deer, raccoons, coyotes, birds, rabbits, squirrels and the occasional freshwater otter are easy to find.

.i ...
: Farm evenings are amazing this time of year. The fields that back up to the creek mark the line from which the golden hills rise in small mounds toward the sky. The sky has been filled with unique summer clouds that offer a texture much richer than a clear sky.

.i ...
: In the final hour of the day, spectacular sunsets rich with color are delivered. For a moment the image is so intense, so lucid and pure that we forget about everything but witnessing the beauty of the world.
