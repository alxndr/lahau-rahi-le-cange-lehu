| .i mi nelci lonu citsi binxo | I love the change in seasons.
|  | I understand that our seasons may not be as extreme as many of the regions on our planet, but I still love the crisp fall that settles over our farm.
|  | The peach and apricot trees are turning amazing colors.
|  | Their leaves are an array of oranges, reds and yellows that change by the day until they fall from the tree in a poetic dance.
|  | There, they mingle with the lush, green shoots of cover crop that are emerging from the soil.
|  | More stiff winds are sure to come in the next weeks, leaving only bare branches that are an amazingly vibrant, deep red color.
|  | Soon, Ricardo and his team will walk through the orchard with pruning shears, bringing order to the branches that grew this way and that over the summer, setting the trees up to produce the ideal number of flowers in the spring and fruit in the summer..
|---
|  | Below the stone fruit orchard, the whistling of harvest crews picking kale carries in the cold air across the farm.
|  | The harvest crews are in full swing
|  | Kales, chards, beets, radishes, lettuce, carrots and cauliflower stand ready to be picked.
|---
|  | The kale plants that have just been harvested look a bit different.
|  | With the largest leaves trimmed from them, their thick trunks are exposed.
|  | On top of these trunks, a small bouquet of baby kale leaves remains.
|  | These will grow, hopefully before the inevitable aphid crop moves in, and with any luck, we will be able to get one more harvest from these plants.
|---
|  | Beyond the field, the creek's wildlife is bustling with activity of the local flock of wild turkeys, who are around more than usual.
|  | It is funny to me how they show up and leave without notice.
|  | The acorns of the oak trees are on the ground and mostly eaten.
|  | The oak leaves are still hanging onto the trees but are deep brown in color.
|  | Below the trees, last season's grass remains yellow.
|  | Below it, the effects of the first rain can be seen, as bright green sprouts of grass emerge from the hills.
|  | It will not be long until the hills are paint green with the next season's grass.
|---
|  | Our Satsuma mandarin trees are coming along.
|  | The crisp nights have helped to turn the color of the fruit orange.
