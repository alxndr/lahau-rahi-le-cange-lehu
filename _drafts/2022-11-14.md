|  | I love the change in seasons.
|  | I understand that our seasons may not be as extreme as many of the regions on our planet, but I still  love the crisp fall that settles over our farm.
|  | The peach and apricot trees are turning amazing colors.
|  |  Their leaves are ana array of oranges, red and yellows that change by the day until they fall from the tree inapoetic  dance.
|  |  There,  they mingle with the lush, green shoots of c       .
