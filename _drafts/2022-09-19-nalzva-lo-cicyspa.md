|  | There are not many things that are more beautiful to me than the sight of a clean field populated with healthy crops, absent of weeds.
|  | Planting equipment is linear, putting straight and precisely spaced lines of seeds or transplants on a bed of soil.
|  | This makes it really easy to see the crop we planted.
|  | If everything goes well, then my carrots, which are six lines to a bed, can be seen as six green rows separated by a few inches of dirt.
|  | Right now, the field of carrots I am looking at is nicely spaced and the morning's irrigation is beginning to dry in spots, leaving a marbled look of browns and blacks across the clean field of carrots.
|  | 
| .i le ti purdi pu na roroi melbi | This field didn't always look beautiful.
| .i da'inai ti fegli puza | In fact, not that long ago it was an "ugly" field.
| .i lo sirji noi cnici pe lo dembi cu nalselviska ri'a lo derjbe pe lo cicyspa | The _now_ neat lines of seeds couldn't be seen because they were overpowered by the germination of weeds.
|  | The tiny carrot seeds were there, and when we planted them in the ground, it was free of weeds.
|  | After watering the seed, the whole field was black with wet soil.
|  | Soon the carrots germinated, along with all of the weed seeds.
|  | A cultivator yielded little success in killing the weeds, and the whole field was a blanket of green.
|  | 
|  | An extremely talented hand crew went through the field and plucked the little grass weeds from the soil, tossing them into the furrow where tractor tires go, leaving the carrots on top of the bed in their neat lines.
|  | Behind the crew of farm workers, the field was beautiful again.
|  | For obvious reasons, this is not the preferred method of weed control.
|  | It is much better to deal with the weeds before the carrot seeds get planted.
|  | 
|  | We needed a new strategy, so we solarized the rest of our carrot ground.
|  | Solarizing a field is a process where we water the beds and put a thin layer of plastic over them, then the hot sun raises the soil temperature to a level that kills the weeds and weed seeds.
|  | Next we take the plastic off and plant our carrots, and the crop that emerges is beautiful.
