|  | There is a gravel road that sits atop the levee that separates our recently cultivated asparagus field from Cache Creek.
|  | The creek's riparian habitat houses much of the farm's wildlife.
|  | A flock of turkeys was scattered over half of the field, scratching and pecking away at their meals — bugs, roots, seeds, the occasional snake or lizard.
|  | At the sight of my approaching pickup truck, they gathered into a group and watched to see what I would do.
|  | Anticipating they would head for the creek, I sped up to get as close a look at the flock of about thirty birds as I could.
|  | The group headed slowly, but directly toward the road.
|  | There were a few large birds that lead the way, followed by the others in a tear-drop formation.
|  | We intersected on top of the gravel road.
|---
|  | Turkeys don't fly unless they have to, and me in my pickup was more of an annoyance than a threat to these birds.
|  | Driving behind them, I watched them bounce off each foot as they moved forward, letting their necks absorb the movement of their bodies — their heads steady, turning on occasion to look at me.
|  | The resemblance between them and Jurassic Park's raptors was easily visible.
|---
|  | Turkeys have been around for quite some time.
|  | More recently, they were a focus of the original Thanksgiving celebration, and our society has continued with the tradition.
|  | Trying to put myself back a couple hundred years ago, I can see the cause for the fall season celebration.
|  | It was during this time, just before the harsh winter arrived, that people had harvested (hopefully) the bounty of their summer work.
|  | For them, the food that would be eaten through the winter had better be stored away by now — with all of that work done, I would have thrown a dinner party too!
|---
|  | One would think that being a farmer I would have made the connection of Thanksgiving to fall long ago, but it wasn't until recently that it sank in for me.
|  | In California, we are spoiled by mild winters that allow us to harvest crops year round.
|  | In many parts of the United States, a long cold season is beginning, a season that provides no conditions for the growth of food — only conditions for food storage.
|---
|  | I hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving. Enjoy your boxes this week. Be sure to find us on Instagram [@farmerthaddeus] and [@farmfreshtoyou].
