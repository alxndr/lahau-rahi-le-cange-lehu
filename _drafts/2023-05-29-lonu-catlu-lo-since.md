# <span class="jbobau">lonu catlu lo since</span> â€” Snake Sighting

|  | As the truck and trailer came to a skidding stop on the gravel road, I jumped out of the truck, then remembered to turn of the diesel engine in the hope of getting some good audio of the hissing.
|  | That glimmer on the end of the serpent was what I suspected, a rattle â€” each nub the result of one skin shed.
|  | It was a beautiful and huge rattlesnake, the back half still in the gravel road, the front starting to make its way up a bank on the side of the road.
|---
|  | Noticing me, and wanting to be where it came from, not where it was headed, the snake turned and crossed the road, showing off its size, grace and speed.
|  | I moved to try to get in front of it in order to take a picture of that impressive rattle.
|  | It poked its head into a hole at the side of the road which for some reason horrified me.
|  | The thought of three full feet of rattlesnake disappearing into the ground was too much.
|  | If I were a ground squirrel, I would never find comfort in my tunnel again.
|---
|  | The handsome creature pulled its head back out and slithered slowly into the shade and terrain of a black walnut tree.
|  | Its body, tattooed with a brown and tan pattern, slowly disappeared until the snake thought it was safe.
|  | All that was visible was the last six inches, including the splendid rattle which hung over a root in the ground, perfectly still.
|  | As I stood there, I felt a rush of life and excitement.
|  | So many thoughts.
|  | It didn't make a sound; not surprising that a snake that old didn't rattle at all.
|  | Some folks have an unreasonable fear of snakes, and many rural folks would have killed it.
|  | For generations, people have been killing rattlesnakes.
|  | The rattle, meant to be a warning system screaming "I am here, go somewhere else!," turned into a location system, "I am here, come kill me!"
|  | In my humble opinion, we have been breeding these creatures to be silent.
|  | If they rattle, they die; if they stay quiet, they live.
|  | This one was old and no doubt at some point its life was extended by not rattling.
|---
|  | As I stood there, I had no desire to kill the snake, but I had a fleeting urge to mess with it.
|  | What would happen if I grabbed the rattle?
|  | It seemed impossible that the snake would be able to whirl around and bite me, but the thought of it made my arm tingle.
|  | What a dumb idea.
|  | The people most bit by rattlesnakes are young, drunk men.
|  | Good thing I'm old.
