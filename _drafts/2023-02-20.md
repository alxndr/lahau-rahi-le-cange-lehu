# <span class="jbobau">...</span> — Flyover

|  | The hills are starting to turn green, and from an airplane their color is the only thing about them that looks the same as it does from the ground.
|  | The landscape is almost unrecognizable: it has no depth, only texture, and the feleing of it being big is gone.
|  | The hills that normally are the backdrop to the farm are an obstacle that requires Greg to make a small adjustment to fly over them, — a task the little plane has no issue doing.
|  | As he flies, my eyes are glued to the ground, trying to translate my intimate knowledge of the landscape from the ground into an understanding of the bird's eye view I temporarily have of the valley.
|  | 
|  | I recognize a field; it has long lines of many different colors that run from one end of the field to another, — shades of green and reds that stack up next to each other, filling a rectangular space.
|  | It looks much different than the surrounding farms; the solid blocks of orchard or silage crops stand out from this vintage point.
|  | Many colors in the same field are a tell-tale sign of our style of agriculture, — lots of different vegetables growing in the same field.
|  | I recognize the barn and house of Full Belly Farm, a farm that looks the same as ours from the air and is home to the Hoes Down Festival.
|  | 
|  | We follow the creek east.
|  | The walnut orchards are bare trees, perfectly spaced on a grid pattern, cows grazing on pasture are little blobs and bare fields are written with the patterns of the last tractor tracks that passed across them.
|  | It is obvious which fields were driven with GPS (perfectly square and parallel tire tracks) and which fields were driven the old-fashioned way (pretty square, but just crooked enough to have some character).
|  | 
|  | Beyond the bend is our farm and I am excited to see it.
|  | I attempt to narrate.
|  | "Here is where our first tomatoes will be planted, there is a kale field, and that is the new orchard.
|  | Look!
|  | The farm office, the shop, some mixed vegetables and where our peppers and eggplant will go."
|  | In a moment, the farm is gone behind us, leaving so many details that were noticed, but it only took a few moments to buzz the whole farm.
|  | I'll ask him to do it again, so I can firmly plant these images of our farm into memory.
