# <span class="jbobau">...</span> — The Winter Sun's Path

|  | It is a bright clear day, but the sun does not properly warm up the valley.
|  | It hangs to the side, over the hills to the south, and then slips away early.
shady, summer hideouts ignored.
|  | Bright green grasses soak up the energy to grow over the corners and edges of fields that were bare and dusty in the summer.
|  | The carrots, fennel and leeks look strong and healthy.
|  | They look so good, I think they enjoy working these short days.
|  | 
|  | Soon, we will see the days lengthen.
|  | The sun will angle itself a little more overhead, and we will notice each week as it changes.
|  | Tiny carrots now in the field that are only a wire-thin stem and roots with two leaves will take that sun and slowly transform themselves into strong roots and bushy tops.
|  | By the time we eat those carrots and get some of that solar energy for ourselves, the sun will be riding much higher in the sky.
|  | Then, our tomatoes and melons will be ready to capture it.
|  | And, when those sun-filled tomatoes are ready to eat, the sun will be shining directly overhead again.
|  | It will not stay right above for long, though.
|  | It is a good thing that it does eventually fly lower down on the horizon.
|  | If it got stuck overhead, we would use the long, bright days to grow tomatoes forever, and soon we would get sicke of eating them all the time.
|  | So, it is good that it lowers itself back down over the hard squash and kale as they are planted, and then harvested in the fall.
|  | 
|  | My ramblings about tomatoes and endless summer days are a way off, because the shortest day of the year is approaching.
|  | At four-thirty in the evening, the sun will already be down behind our valley hills.
|  | The fennel and kale will be huddled out in the cold and dark without a tomato in sight.
|  | I'll be warm inside the house with my family and feeling the holiday spirit.
|  | I wish all of you good cheer during these long nights and holidays.
|  | 
|  | Enjoy your boxes this week.
