# <span class="jbobau">lo vrusi pe lo vensa</span> — The Taste of Spring

: We take care of a lot of living organisms on the farm. On this sunny day in May, many unique varieties of food-bearing plants exist in raised beds, orchard rows and trellises out here. Some of these plants are germinating from seeds today and others have been on the farm for nearly 20 years. We feed them, water them and protect them from competitors and pests, and, in the end, we all eat their tasty leaves and fruits. Sometimes, I like to remind myself what it is we are really doing because it is easy to forget when we are caught up in the daily whirlwind of work this time of year. Planting sweet peppers and more heirloom tomatoes, harvesting greens, weeding vegetable rows, irrigating all our crops, and everything else we do.

.i ...
: We're harvesting and bunching beautiful spinach plants, and I am excited about how buttery and full of flavor the spinach is. It strikes me as a strong, filling food and I can absolutely see why Popeye loves it. If I ever breed a new variety of spinach, I am going to name it Popeye. The radishes we're bunching are particularly flavorful and spicy, just like they should be! Ours are big and bright and looking very nice.

.i ...
: The signs of summer are popping up all around. Our irrigation canal is delivering cool, flowing water to the new crops. Our melons are still small plants, but the stand is strong and, with more hot weather, they'll soon be as big as the tomatoes are right now. The tomato plants are looking very healthy and have begun to flower. Soon those flowers will transform into tiny, green fruits, and if we are patient, come July they'll be big, succulent, colorful tomatoes. The peach fruits are golf ball-sized, the figs are nearly full size, but not yet the slightest bit sweet. Soon, soon. I am not done enjoying spring veggies.
