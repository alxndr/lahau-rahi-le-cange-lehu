# <span class="jbobau">le dausnu pe lo .estorni</span> — The Starling Debate

| jbobau | English
|-|-
| .i le dalgunma be lo .estorni cu xabju le cange | There is a flock of starlings that resides on the farm.
| .i ko'agoi lei .estorni cu kansi'u loka citka je loka sipna je loka klama | Starlings eat, sleep and travel together.
| .i lo galraipau be loi barda cindu joi maprultricu cu zdani ko'a | The tops of the big oak and eucalyptus trees are their nesting grounds.
| .i lonu viska ko'a bu'u loi pezli na frili .i ku'i loi su'o renono cmalu zei ja'urxe'a cu torbrato'a fa'a ri | They are not easily seen among the leaves, but **hundreds of** little beaks squeak at each other **in the quick high-pitched murmurs that reveal their presence to a trained ear**.
| .i mu'i leka bredi be lonu muvdu keikei pe le girzu zo'u so'u cipni cu cliva .i lo velvi'u cu klaje'i | When the group is ready to change locations, a couple of birds leave and the remainder follow.
| .i cy li'urxa'u le cange | They travel over the farm **like a swarm of insects, swooping up and down, to the left or right in a fluid motion**.
| .i le selska pe le dalgunma ge'u cu binxo | The color of the flock changes **as more or less daylight can be seen through the three-dimensional mass of birds**.
|---
| .i lei dalgunma cu zdile je nolmle je selte'a | The flocks are entertaining, even graceful or spooky **to watch fly around the farm**.
| .i ku'i lenu kufra sepre cu canci ki'u lonu le dalgunma cu stuvi'e lo rutpurdi be lo makcu figre ja najysmela | However, the warm fuzzy feelings fade **as quickly as** the mass can settle itself onto an orchard of ripe figs or peaches.
| .i lo ti envaxire cipni cu steci nelci lo vifne grute .i le nu nelci poi mansa ro xamgu tervecnu | These non-native birds have a unique taste for fresh fruit, **one that would meet the quality standards of any good produce buyer**.
| .i | As soon as a fig or peach is ready to harvest, a starling will gut the fruit, ruining it for human consumption.
| .i | The harvest crews are given strict orders to get to the fruit first.
| .i | Starlings are smart; the bird canon [sic], which simulates the sound of a gunshot, that we installed to scare them from the grapes worked for about a day before they recognized its sound and rhythm.
|---
| .i | The fennel field is in the middle of being hoed.
| .i | The little plants stand about six inches tall and the weeds about four.
| .i | Tractor cultivation cleaned up many of the weeds and the hoeing crew goes next.
| .i | The combination of the two techniques results in all of the ground being turned over, the weeds failing and the insect population left with no home.
| .i | I walked out to inspect the progress of the hoeing crew and was surprised to note the entire flock of starlings in the fennel patch.
| .i | The birds were jumping around chasing down dinner before settling into an evening of gossiping in the tall oak trees.
| .i | They noticed me, but paid little attention to my presence, — at best they were courteous enough to hop out of my way.
|---
| .i | It didn't take long for me to wonder if the bugs they were eating were good or bad bugs.
| .i | It also didn't take long for me to imagine how great it would be if the starlings and I could make a deal, — they could have an unlimited supply of fresh fruit in peace, in exchange for pest termination services.
