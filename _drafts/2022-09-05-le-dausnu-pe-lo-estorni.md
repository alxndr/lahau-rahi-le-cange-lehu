# <span class="jbobau">le dausnu pe lo .estorni</span> — The Starling Debate

| jbobau | English
|-|-
| .i le dalgunma be lo .estorni cu xabju le cange | There is a flock of starlings that resides on the farm.
| .i ko'agoi lei .estorni cu kansi'u loka citka je loka sipna je loka klama | Starlings eat, sleep and travel together.
| .i lo galraipau be loi barda cindu joi maprultricu cu zdani ko'a | The tops of the big oak and eucalyptus trees are their nesting grounds.
| .i lonu viska ko'a bu'u loi pezli na frili .i ku'i loi su'o renono cmalu zei ja'urxe'a cu torbrato'a fa'a ri | They are not easily seen among the leaves, but **hundreds of** little beaks squeak at each other **in the quick high-pitched murmurs that reveal their presence to a trained ear**.
|  | When the group is ready to change locations, a couple of birds leave and the remainder follow.
|  | They travel over the farm like a swarm of insects, swooping up and down, to the left or right in a fluid motion.
|  | The color of the flock changes as more or less daylight can be seen through the three-dimensional mass of birds.
|---
|  | The flocks are entertaining, even graceful or spooky to watch fly around the farm.
|  | However, the warm fuzzy feelings fade as quickly as the mass can settle itself onto an orchard of ripe figs or peaches.
|  | These non-native birds have a unique taste for fresh fruit, one that would meet the quality standards of any good produce buyer.
|  | As soon as a fig or peach is ready to harvest, a starling will gut the fruit, ruining it for human consumption.
|  | The harvest crews are given strict orders to get to the fruit first.
|  | Starlings are smart; the bird canon [sic], which simulates the sound of a gunshot, that we installed to scare them from the grapes worked for about a day before they recognized its sound and rhythm.
|  | 
|  | The fennel field is in the middle of being hoed.
|  | The little plants stand about six inches tall and the weeds about four.
|  | Tractor cultivation cleaned up many of the weeds and the hoeing crew goes next.
|  | The combination of the two techniques results in all of the ground being turned over, the weeds failing and the insect population left with no home.
|  | I walked out to inspect the progress of the hoeing crew and was surprised to note the entire flock of starlings in the fennel patch.
|  | The birds were jumping around chasing down dinner before settling into an evening of gossiping in the tall oak trees.
|  | They noticed me, but paid little attention to my presence, — at best they were courteous enough to hop out of my way.
|  | 
|  | It didn't take long for me to wonder if the bugs they were eating were good or bad bugs.
|  | It also didn't take long for me to imagine how great it would be if the starlings and I could make a deal, — they could have an unlimited supply of fresh fruit in peace, in exchange for pest termination services.
