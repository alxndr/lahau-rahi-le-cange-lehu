: The tomato field is full of sticky tomato vines. _The tomato plants are being grown on a neatly-organized trellis system. Each row of tomatoes is five feet apart; each tomato plant is 14 inches from its neighbor. Our tomatoes are indeterminate varieties — a fancy word that mean they need to be trellised because they grow like vines. Our trellis is composed of metal stakes pounded into the ground. As the tomatoes grow, we run a piece of string on both sides of plant and tie the string to each stake. This growing method results in walls of tomato plants every five feet._

: Tomato fields are difficult to navigate. _Most crops, you can walk diagonally across the field, easily stepping over the growing plants. When walking the tomato field, you need to select a row and stick with it until you exit the other side of the field. Tomato plants have a very distinct smell and texture. Even with five feet between each row of tomatoes, you cannot walk through the field without bushing against the sticky vines. The vines have an almost wet feel to them, and brushing up against them causes your clothes to turn green and the smell of tomato is with you for the remainder of the day._

: The maze of corns is excellent habitat for wildlife. _While walking through the field, I randomly picked the same row in which a mother turkey was hiding with her little chicks. She let me get very close before erupting into flight and landing in the oak tree that borders the field. Her little ones reacted differently, — some flew and landed a few rows over, others ran, and one stood completely still and hoped I didn't see it. After the mother landed in the oak tree, she made lots of noise so her little ones would know where to find her. I put myself in their position and realized it must have been a very stressful event_.

: _Down a different row, I heard a rustling. Seconds later, a doe exploded out of the end of the field. I had only a quick view of her as she ran. She was bright reddish-brown in color, and her hindquarters were bright white, with her black tail sticking straight into the air_.
