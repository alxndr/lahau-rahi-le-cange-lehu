| .i lonu catlu lo tsani pe le cange zo'u se cinri ca lo cabjeftu | Our farm skies have been interesting to watch this week.
| .i mi pu viska so'u lo clira zei gunse poi se tarmi vy bu'u la cmafle .i pu zo'u ca lo vanci mi viska lo falplini noi se fagri bu'u le tsani | I spied some early geese making a "V" along the creek, and later that evening, I caught a few meteors burning in the night sky.
| .i lonu klina .e lonu glare cu fadni ca lo donri .i lonu dilnu .e lonu glare cu fadni ca lo nicte | During the day, it is usually clear and hot; other times, it is cloudy and hot.
| .i lonu glanejni cu terprali so'u lo terpurdi ku gi'e ckape lo cmalu terpurdi co muvypu'i | The heat is good for some crops and a menace for others, `especially` our little transplants.
| .i lonu stika loka djacygau tcaci keiku .e lonu pilno lo mlilenku cerni ku keiku cu te rivbi lonu traji jelca keiku mi'a | By adjusting our watering habits and taking advantage of the cool mornings, we can avoid getting burned too badly.
|  |
| .i ca lo clira cerni ku cfari lonu sombo | We start planting in the early morning.
| .i lo cermurse ca lonu mi'a setca ra'i le spadi'u lo ralci citspa co ri'orko'i ku le mi'a dertu | As soon as there is light, we are slipping fragile, young kale `and chard` seedlings `fresh` from the greenhouse into our soil, `which already has moisture from a pre-irrigation the day before`.
|  | As soon as the first several beds are filled, we twist open the sprinklers on those rows to relieve the little babes from the dry heat.
|  | On these hot days, we try to finish early in the afternoon to avoid the exposure to the dry, 100-degree wind that may rise up and threaten to wither the plant before we can put the water on.
|  |
|  | It has been hot enough that the tiny plants have slumped over sideways despite our efforts.
|  | When this happens, it takes some faith to remain calm and know that all is not lost.
|  | We go through this every summer, and the plants recover in a day or so with a steady supply of water.
| .o'usai viska lonu lo spati cu sraji | It is a huge relief to see them perk up!
|  | Some of the plants that we've been watching closely are fennels, chards, kales, collards, broccoli, leeks, cauliflower and lettuce.
|  | We're planting seeds too, so look out for fall vegetables of all kinds coming along in September!
