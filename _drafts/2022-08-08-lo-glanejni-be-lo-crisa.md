| .i lonu catlu lo tsani pe le cange zo'u se cinri ca lo cabjeftu | Our farm skies have been interesting to watch this week.
| .i mi pu viska lo clira zei gunse poi se tarmi vy bu'u la cmafle .i pu zo'u ca lo vanci mi viska lo falplini noi se fagri bu'u le tsani | I spied some early geese making a "V" along the creek, and later that evening, I caught a few meteors burning in the night sky.
|  | During the day, it is usually clear and hot; other times, it is cloudy and hot.
|  | The heat is good for some crops and a menace for others, especially our little transplants.
|  | By adjusting our watering habits and taking advantage of the cool mornings, we can avoid getting burned too badly.
|
|  | We start planting in the early morning.
|  | As soon as there is light, we are slipping fragile, young kale and chard seedlings fresh from the greenhouse into our soil, which already has moisture from a pre-irrigation the day before.
|  | As soon as the first several beds are filled, we twist open the sprinklers on those rows to relieve the little babes from the dry heat.
|  | On these hot days, we try to finish early in the afternoon to avoid the exposure to the dry, 100-degree wind that may rise up and threaten to wither the plant before we can put the water on.
|
|  | It has been hot enough that the tiny plants have slumped over sideways despite our efforts.
|  | When this happens, it takes some faith to remain calm and know that all is not lost.
|  | We go through this every summer, and the plants recover in a day or so with a steady supply of water.
|  | It is a huge relief to see them perk up!
|  | some of the plants that we've been watching closely are fennels, chards, kales, collards, broccoli, leeks, cauliflower and lettuce.
|  | We're planting seeds too, so look out for fall vegetables of all kinds coming along in September!
