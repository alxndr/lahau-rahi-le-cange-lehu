|---
| | While I was growing up on the farm, I was extremely excited about Halloween.
| | An unwritten rule in our family was that processed sugar of any type was not permitted.
| | I was envious of my friends who grew up with Pepsi and Doritos in their daily lunches.
| | Today, I am grateful that my parents instilled in me the habits of eating food that my body was good at processing.
| | Back then, Halloween was the one chance every year my browsers and I had to load up with high fructose corn syrup and chocolate.
|---
| | My brothers and I took the annual opportunity to acquire candy very seriously, and the choice of which community we would go hunt for it was left up to us.
| | After years of attempts at obtaining the highest volume of candy possible per evening of trick-or-treating, it finally dawned on us that technique, not location, was the answer.
|---
| | It was at this point that roller blades were added to every costume.
| | I wish that I could claim credit for the paradigm shift in our approach, but my younger brother Freeman and our close friend Danny, now a manager with Farm Fresh To you, earn the credit for recognizing the potential that resulted when Halloween, trick-or-treating, and roller blades were mixed together.
|---
| | When Freeman and Danny began dressing up with roller blades for Halloween, I was too old to reap the benefits with them, but I was not too old to be jealous of their success.
| | In an evening of trick-or-treating on roller blades, they were able to hit two to three times as many houses during the "candy hours" as people looking for treats an foot.
| | At the end of their first Halloween run with roller blades, Freeman and Danny had racked up a solid pillowcase each of candy.
| | This accomplishment on our organic farm was equivalent to the success of a pirate ship finding the mark on a valid treasure map.
|---
| | It would take less than a month before the loot was consumed, and we were back to the snack routine of bread, cheese and whatever food we could scrounge from the farm.
| | Our beloved mother would answer our cries of: "There is nothing to eat on the farm!" with "The cold room is packed with fresh fruits and vegetables."
| | As a child, that fact was torturous.
| | Today, my brothers and I look back and realize that these painful lessons from childhood resulted in invaluable adult eating habits that serve us well.
|---
| | Enjoy your boxes this week and realize that an annual binge of sugar is fun, but that eating healthy as a child is one of the few gifts that keeps on giving.
