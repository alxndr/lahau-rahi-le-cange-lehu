: Near the creek there is a huge oak tree that was named the Mother Oak by my older brother, Noah. Standing **under** the tree yields **the most impressive** view of the massive branches that stem from the **six-foot diameter** trunk. The branches follow the trajectory of a firework, **starting straight up and arching away from the trunk, eventually turning back down to the ground**. **Hanging** from the branches are **many** small limbs that fork into twigs which bear the **uniquely shaped** oak leaves.

: This is the time of year that the acorns fall from the oak trees. This year's crop of acorns is being gathered to add to the oak preserve **just east of the Mother Oak**. The plan is to collect acorns and store them in the barn **until the rainy season**. Then we will drop three acorns in each of the spots designated **to grow an oak tree**. **We have the irrigation system, and the next couple years of watering the little trees through the summer months should yield a nice stand of oak trees.**

.i lo preti poi mi caca'o pensi zo'u ei kau sarcu le nu mycy cu dzena lei ti tricu kei ji le nu jajgau loi cindynarge le mulpau pe le cange .i de'a mi krici le jei sarcu lenu ke'a se dzena mycy
: The question I have been toiling with is: Should **all** of these oak trees be descendants of the Mother Oak, or should I gather **a mixture of** acorns from oak trees all over the farm? Originally, I felt **strongly** that they should all be from the Mother Oak **because this patch of trees is adjacent to her**.

.i le tsiju be mycy zo'u .uinai ke'a moxna
: Unfortunately, her crop of acorns this year is extremely light. **Some years the acorn crop is large enough to make a solid layer under the oak tree — this year it was difficult to find even one. Moyra and I spent quite some time scanning the floor underneath the massive tree to find only a few acorns, — most of which had been chewed up by the local fauna. I started looking in the tree which proved to be more productive. At first glance, there was nothing visible but leaves; it took a few minutes before I spotted the first acorn. It was well hidden, but once I saw the acorn it stood out like a sore thumb. It was bright green and pointy, with a hat on it the texture of bark.**

.i
: **After I got my "eyes on" for the acorns, the searching went better, but still only fielded half of a small baggie. We'll plant these acorns closest to the Mother Oak and scatter an even mixture of acorns from the other oak trees on the farm through the remaining patch.**
