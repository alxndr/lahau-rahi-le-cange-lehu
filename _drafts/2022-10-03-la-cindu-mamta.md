|  | Near the creek there is a huge oak tree that was named the Mother Oak by my older brother, Noah.
|  | Standing under the tree yields the most impressive view of the massive branches that stem fro mthe six-foot diameter trunk.
|  | The branches follow the trajectory of a firework, starting straight up and arching away from the trunk, eventually turning back down to the ground.
|  | Hanging from the branches are many small limbs that fork into twigs which bear the uniquely shaped oak leaves.
|---
|  | This is the time of year that the acorns fall from the oak trees.
|  | This year's crop of acorns is being gathered to add to the oak preserve just east of the Mother Oak.
|  | The plan is to collect acorns and store them in the barn until the rainy season.
|  | Then we will drop three acorns in each of the spots designated to grow an oak tree.
|  | We have the irrigation system, and the next couple years of watering the little trees through the summer months should yield a nice stand of oak trees.
|---
|  | The question I have been toiling with is: Should all of these oak trees be descendants of the Mother Oak, or should I gather a mixture of acorns from oak trees all over the farm?
|  | Originally, I felt strongly that they should all be from the Mother Oak because this patch of trees is adjacent to her.
|---
|  | Unfortunately, her crop of acorns this year is extremely light.
|  | Some years the acorn crop is large enough to make a solid layer under the oak tree — this year it was difficult to find even one.
|  | Moyra and I spent quite some time scanning the floor underneath the massive tree to find only a few acorns, — most of which had been chewed up by the local fauna.
|  | I started looking in the tree which proved to be more productive.
|  | At first glance, there was nothing visible but leaves; it took a few minutes before I spotted the first acorn.
|  | It was well hidden, but once I saw the acorn it stood out like a sore thumb.
|  | It was bright green and pointy, with a hat on it the texture of bark.
|---
|  | After I got my "eyes on" for the acorns, the searching went better, but still only fielded half of a small baggie.
|  | We'll plant these acorns closest to the Mother Oak and scatter an even mixture of acorns from the other oak trees on the farm through the remaining patch.
