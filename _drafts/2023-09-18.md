Planting equipment is linear, putting straight and precisely spaced lines of seeds or transplants on a bed of soil. This makes it really easy to see the crops once they grow to a few inches tall. If everything goes well, then the carrots, which are six lines to a bed, can be seen as six green rows separated by a few inches of dirt, nicely spaced. When freshly irrigated, it creates a marbled look of browns and blacks across the clean field of carrots.

Fields don't always look this beautiful. When the seeds were planted in the ground, the soil was free of weeds. Soon the carrots germinated, along with weed seeds. A cultivator yielded little success in killing the weeds, and the whole field was a blanket of green.
|---
An extremely talented hand crew went through the field and plucked the little grass weeds from the soil, tossing them into the furrow where tractor tires go, leaving the carrots on top of the bed in their neat lines. Behind the crew of farm workers, the field was beautiful again. For obvious reasons, this is not the preferred method of weed control. It is much better to deal with the weeds before the carrot seeds get planted, but in organic farming, you sometimes use people power since chemical herbicides are not an option. Next time, we will solarize the field before we plant, using the heat of the sun to rid the field of weeds.
